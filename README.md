EEG Prosthetic
==============
EEG Prosthetic is an interesting bridge to the divide of possible and plausible.

Here is a small snippit of the code I've written for the arm.

Features
--------

-Ability to read brainwaves.

-Functionality of ability to grip without arm or use of arm.

-General arm movements for impaired with brain activation.

Installation
------------

Installation of the current code can be downloaded by following the source link and the main software will be under the headset library.

Instructions
------------

1. Put the headset on your head with electrodes lining the sides of your head above your ears and a singular electrode on the front left side of your forehead.

2. Turn on the headset then turn on the arduino and the library will load.

3. Try to concentrate and the prosthetic will intuitively close on it's own just from your brain power!
